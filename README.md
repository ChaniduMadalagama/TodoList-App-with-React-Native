# TodoList App With React Native

This code is a React Native application that allows the user to add tasks to a list. The main components used in this code are View, Text, TextInput, and TouchableOpacity.

The state hook useState is used to create a state variable task and a function setTask that allows the user to update the value of task.

The Task component is defined in a separate file and is imported into this file. The Task component takes a prop text which is used to display the text of the task.

The handleAddTask function is called when the user presses the "add" button. It currently only logs the value of task to the console.

The StyleSheet component is used to define the styles for the different elements of the application.

The KeyboardAvoidingView component is used to prevent the keyboard from covering the input field when the user is typing.

Overall, this code sets up the basic structure for a task list application and allows the user to add new tasks to the list.
